# Graham-scan
This Graham scan algorithm can be used to find the convex hull of a set of data points!

In this project, I create my own version of the Graham scan algorithm for computing the convex hull of a set of data points. This code takes the form of a function get_hull() which takes as argument a  2×𝑁 array of point coordinate pairs  (𝑥,𝑦) and returns the subset of those points which would make up the vertices of the convex hull.

To ensure the code completes this task successfully, I test that it can complete the following tasks:
1. The get_hull() function returns a variable of the correct type.
2. The returned variable has correct size and shape.
3. The correct subset of initial points are given in the hull.
4. The function returns the trivial hull of 3 points.

The Code for this can be seen in the Graham-scan file

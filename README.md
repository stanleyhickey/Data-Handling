# Graham-scan
This Graham scan algorithm can be used to find the convex hull of a set of data points!


The goal of this project:

Create, from scratch, your own version of the Graham scan algorithm for computing the convex hull. Your code should be in the form of a function get_hull(points) which takes as argument a  2×𝑁 array of point coordinate pairs  (𝑥,𝑦) and returns the subset of those points which would make up the vertices of the convex hull.
